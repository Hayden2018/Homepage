    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there! My name is Hayden. I am a software developer at Bosch, an automotive and industrial technology company.
      Currently, I am focusing on the development of web applications for purchasing related use cases with
      emphasis on applying AI technologies to reduce manual work in the purchasing process.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a Bachelor and Master of Big Data Science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),
      where I honed my skills and developed a passion for solving problems with technology.
      In my current role at Bosch, I have the opportunity to work on features and improvements for one of the most
      popular e-commerce site in Hong Kong.
      Additionally, I have successfully delivered an HR workflow project using ServiceNow in my previous job.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have created a few open-source projects to solve the problems that I encounter in my daily life. You can find
      them <a routerLink="/works">here</a> on this website.
      I am always eager to use technology to solve real-life problems. If you have any interesting project ideas or
      would like to collaborate, please feel free to <a (click)="currentSection = 4" style="cursor: pointer;">contact me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my free time, I enjoy playing the piano with Mozart being my favorite composer.
      I am also a Go enthusiast, holding the rank of amateur one dan. My interest in machine learning was sparked after
      learning about AlphaGo, and this has led me to explore the field as a hobbyist.
